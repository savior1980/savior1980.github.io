<p class="frase"> Empty your memory, 
 with a free()...
 like a pointer!
 If you cast a pointer to a integer,
 it becomes the integer,
 if you cast a pointer to a struct,
 it becomes the struct...
 The pointer can crash...,
 and can Overflow...
 Be a pointer my friend...</p><p align="right">-- Frikada que me han enviado al correo del curro... Bruce Lee programaba en C, fijo</p>

<p class="chorus">	
"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,
"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."</p><p align="right">-- <a href="http://www.bobdylan.com/songs/watchtower.html">Banda sonora</a> del último capítulo de la tercera temporada de BSG</p>
